Response: **Step-by-Step Plan:**

1. Load the dataset using pandas and filter out the relevant column 'Quantity'.
2. Count the occurrences of each unique quantity.
3. Sort the quantities in ascending order based on their counts.
4. Extract the three least common quantities.
5. Return the list of the three least commonly ordered quantities.

**Code Implementation:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset and filter out the 'Quantity' column
df = pd.read_parquet("hf://datasets/cardiffnlp/databench/data/065_RFM/all.parquet")
quantities = df['Quantity']

# Count the occurrences of each unique quantity
quantity_counts = quantities.value_counts()

# Sort the quantities in ascending order based on their counts
sorted_quantities = quantity_counts.sort_values()

# Extract the three least common quantities
three_least_common_quantities = sorted_quantities.head(3).index.tolist()

# Return the list of the three least commonly ordered quantities
print(three_least_common_quantities)
```

**Verification:**

To verify the correctness of the output, you can check the dataset manually or run the code on the provided dataset. Ensure that the three quantities returned are indeed the least commonly ordered ones based on the counts in the dataset.
