# Count the number of such rows

Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 
Error: 'What is the highest degree or level of school you have *completed*?'


Observations and Changes Made : 
1. The column name in the code attempt contains asterisks (*) which are not valid in pandas column names. Remove the asterisks to correct the column name.
2. The column name should be enclosed in quotes to correctly reference it in the dataframe.
3. The `isin` method should be used with a list of valid values to filter the dataframe correctly.

Re-attempted Code with Modifications :
