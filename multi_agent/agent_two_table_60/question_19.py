import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/060_Bakery.parquet')

# Step 2: Load the pandas library (already done above)

# Step 3: Filter out the 'Transaction' and 'period_day' columns from the DataFrame
df = df[['Transaction', 'period_day']]

# Step 4: Filter the DataFrame to get rows where 'period_day' is'morning'
morning_transactions = df[df['period_day'] =='morning']

# Step 5: Get the 'Transaction' values for these rows and select the two smallest values
bottom_2_transactions = morning_transactions['Transaction'].nsmallest(2).tolist()

# Step 6: Convert the resulting pandas Series to a list (already done above)

# Step 7

Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 
[1, 2]


Observations and Changes Made:

The code provided is correct and follows the expected answer type and uses the relevant columns. The code filters the DataFrame to get transactions made in the morning, selects the two smallest transaction numbers, and prints them as a list. There are no changes needed, and the output generation is correct.

Re-attempted Code with Modifications:
