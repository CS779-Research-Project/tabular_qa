   import pandas as pd
   ```

2. Load the dataset from the parquet file into a pandas DataFrame.
   ```python
   df = pd.read_parquet('data/064_Clustering.parquet')
   ```

3. Filter out the 'legs' column from the DataFrame to focus on the relevant data.
   ```python
   legs = df['legs']
   ```

4. Calculate the maximum number of legs found in the 'legs' column.
   ```python
   max_legs = legs.max()
   ```

5. Print the result, which is the maximum number of legs an animal has according to the dataset.
   ```python
   print(max_legs)
   ```

The complete code is as follows:
