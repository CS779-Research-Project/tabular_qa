   import pandas as pd
   ```

2. Load the dataset '061_Disneyland' from the parquet file into a pandas DataFrame.
   ```python
   df = pd.read_parquet('data/061_Disneyland.parquet')
   ```

3. Filter out the column 'Review_ID' from the DataFrame to work with only the relevant column.
   ```python
   review_id = df['Review_ID']
   ```

4. Find the maximum value in the 'Review_ID' column, which represents the highest review ID.
   ```python
   max_review_id = review_id.max()
   ```

5. Print the result, which is the maximum review ID.
   ```python
   print(max_review_id)
   ```

The provided code is already well-structured and should execute correctly to answer the question. It follows the instructions and uses the pandas library to manipulate the DataFrame and find the maximum review ID.
