Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 
<string>:7: FutureWarning: The default of observed=False is deprecated and will be changed to True in a future version of pandas. Pass observed=False to retain current behavior or observed=True to adopt the future default and silence this warning.
['Turks and Caicos Islands', 'Suriname', 'South Sudan']


Observations and Changes Made : 
1. The FutureWarning is not relevant to the logic of the code. It is a warning about pandas' future behavior and can be ignored or addressed by adding `observed=False` to the `groupby` method.
2. The code is almost correct, but it needs to convert the index of the sorted average ratings to a list before selecting the bottom 3 locations.

Re-attempted Code with Modifications :
