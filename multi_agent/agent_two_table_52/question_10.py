Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 
<string>:7: FutureWarning: The default of observed=False is deprecated and will be changed to True in a future version of pandas. Pass observed=False to retain current behavior or observed=True to adopt the future default and silence this warning.

Observations and Changes Made : 
1. The FutureWarning is not relevant to the task and can be ignored.
2. The code is correct and follows the expected answer type and uses the relevant columns.
3. The output generation is stopped here as the code is already correct.

Re-attempted Code with Modifications :
