   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_parquet('data/052_Professional.parquet')
   ```
3. Filter out the columns 'Profession', 'Emotional_Range', and 'Conversation' from the dataframe
   ```python
   df = df[['Profession', 'Emotional_Range', 'Conversation']]
   ```
4. Group the dataframe by 'Profession'
   ```python

Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 
<string>:7: FutureWarning: The default of observed=False is deprecated and will be changed to True in a future version of pandas. Pass observed=False to retain current behavior or observed=True to adopt the future default and silence this warning.
False


Observations and Changes Made : 
1. The FutureWarning is not related to the logic of the code. It is a warning from pandas about a future change in default behavior. This warning can be ignored or addressed by adding `observed=False` when calling `groupby`.
2. The code groups the dataframe by 'Profession' but does not calculate the minimum 'Emotional_Range' and minimum 'Conversation' for each profession.
3. The code checks if the profession with the lowest 'Emotional_Range' also has the lowest 'Conversation' but does not store the results for each profession.
4. The code does not print the result in a clear and understandable way.

Re-attempted Code with Modifications :
