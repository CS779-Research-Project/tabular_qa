import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/001_Forbes.parquet')
# Filter out the columns 'age','selfMade', and 'gender' from the dataframe
df = df[['age','selfMade', 'gender']]
# Filter the dataframe to get the female billionaires who are not self-made
df = df[(df['selfMade'] == False) & (df['gender'] == 'female')]
# Calculate the average age
average_age = df['

Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Observations and Changes Made :
1. The output does not match the expected answer type. The output is a list of ranks, not an average age.
2. The calculation for the average age is missing.
3. The code should filter the dataframe to get the female billionaires who are not self-made and then calculate the average age.

Re-attempted Code with Modifications :
