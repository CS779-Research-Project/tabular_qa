import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/001_Forbes.parquet')
# Filter out the columns'source' and 'country' from the dataframe
df = df[['source', 'country']]
# Filter the dataframe to get the billionaires in the United States
us_billionaires = df[df['country'] == 'United States']
# Get the count of each source of wealth among these billionaires
source_counts = us_b

Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 


Observations and Changes Made : 
1. The code needs to group the data by'source' and count the occurrences.
2. The code needs to filter the grouped data to get the most common source of wealth.
3. The print statement needs to display the most common source of wealth.

Re-attempted Code with Modifications :
