You are an helpful assistant good at breaking down questions for a given table which is a pandas Dataframe.
Please break down the following question into smaller, more manageable steps. Each step should be an instruction in natural language that will be easily executable by one line of python code. All the steps as a whole should be able to solve the question if someone write a python code for each of them.

Also, attempt to write the code for each step in a way that it can be easily copy-pasted and run by someone who is not familiar with the question or the dataset.

Here is some information that will be useful for you to break down the questions : 
- The dataset is a pandas dataframe always
- The relevant columns will be given to you
- The types of the columns will be given to you, more information about all the types is given below
- The expected type of the answer will be given to you
- Make sure that the final answer follows the expected type of the answer
- The output is always of a single line
- First step is always to load the dataset
- Last step is always to print the answer

The types of the columns and the expected types of the answers are as follows :
- 'number' : represents a numerical value, for example, 1, 2.5, 3.14
- 'category' : represents a categorical value, for example, 'apple'. depends on the context which you'll have to infer
- 'date' : represents a date value, for example, 2022-01-01
- 'text' : represents a text value, for example, "Hello, World!", 'A quick brown fox...'
- 'boolean' : represents a boolean value, for example, True, False
- 'url' : represents a url value, for example, "https://www.google.com", 'abobe.com'
- 'list[number]' : represents a list of numerical values, for example, [1, 2, 3], [3.14, 2, 4.56]
- 'list[category]' : represents a list of categorical values, for example, ['apple', 'orange'], ['red', 'green', 'blue']
- 'list[url]' : represents a list of url values, for example, ["https://www.google.com", "https://www.bing.com"], ['abobe.com', 'microsoft.com']


Here are a few examples :
---
Example 1 :
---
Question : What is the average age of the people in the dataframe?
Dataset : 090_Students
All Columns : ['age', 'name']
Relevant Columns : ['age']
Type of the columns : ['number']
Type of the answer : number

Question Breakdown : 
1. Load the dataset
2. Filter out the column 'age' from the dataframe
3. Calculate the average age
4. Print the result

Code Attempt : 
```python
import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/090_Students.parquet')
# Filter out the column 'age' from the dataframe
age = df['age']
# Calculate the average age
average_age = age.mean()
# Print the result
print(average_age)
```

Example 2 :
---
Question : What is the salary of employee who has the highest performance rating?
Dataset : 090_Employees
All Columns : ['salary', 'performance_rating', 'employee_name', 'company_name', 'employee_id']
Relevant Columns : ['salary', 'performance_rating']
Type of the columns : ['number', 'number']
Type of the answer : number

Question Breakdown : 
1. Load the dataset
2. Filter out the columns 'salary' and 'performance_rating' from the dataframe
3. Filter the dataframe to get the employee with the highest performance rating
4. Get the salary of the employee
5. Print the result

Code Attempt :
```python
import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/090_Employees.parquet')
# Filter out the columns 'salary' and 'performance_rating' from the dataframe
df = df[['salary', 'performance_rating']]
# Filter the dataframe to get the employee with the highest performance rating
highest_performance_rating = df['performance_rating'].max()
employee = df[df['performance_rating'] == highest_performance_rating]
# Get the salary of the employee
salary = employee['salary']
# Print the result
print(salary)
```

Kindly be clear, concise and precise in your instructions.

Human: 
Question : Do all animals breathe?
Dataset : 064_Clustering
All Columns : ['animal_name', 'hair', 'feathers', 'eggs', 'milk', 'airborne', 'aquatic', 'predator', 'toothed', 'backbone', 'breathes', 'venomous', 'fins', 'legs', 'tail', 'domestic', 'catsize', 'class_type']
Relevant Columns : ['breathes']
Type of the columns : ['number[uint8]']
Type of the answer : boolean

Question Breakdown :
1. Load the dataset
2. Filter out the column 'breathes' from the dataframe
3. Check if all values in the 'breathes' column are True
4. Print the result

Code Attempt :
```python
import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/064_Clustering.parquet')
# Filter out the column 'breathes' from the dataframe
breathes = df['breathes']
# Check if all values in the 'breathes' column are True
all_breathes = breathes.all()
# Print the result
print(all_breathes)
```

In this case, the 'breathes' column is expected to contain boolean values (True or False), indicating whether each animal in the dataset breathes or not. The 'all()' function is used to check if all values in the 'breathes' column are True, which would mean that all animals in the dataset breathe. If all values are True, the function will return True, otherwise, it will return False.

Note: The 'number[uint8]' type for the 'breathes' column indicates that the values are stored as unsigned 8-bit integers, which can only represent the values 0 and 1. This is consistent with the boolean values True (1) and False (0).


Here is a more complex question that involves multiple steps and requires more advanced pandas operations:

Question : How many animals in the dataset are both aquatic and have a backbone?
Dataset : 064_Clustering
All Columns : ['animal_name', 'hair', 'feathers', 'eggs','milk', 'airborne', 'aquatic', 'predator', 'toothed', 'backbone', 'breathes','venomous', 'fins', 'legs', 'tail', 'domestic', 'catsize', 'class_type']
Relevant Columns : ['aquatic', 'backbone']
Type of the columns : ['number[uint8]', 'number[uint8]']
Type of the answer : number
