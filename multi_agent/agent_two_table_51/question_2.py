import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/051_Pokemon.parquet')
# Filter out the columns 'total' and 'generation' from the dataframe
df = df[['total', 'generation']]
# Filter the dataframe to get the first generation Pokémon
first_generation = df[df['generation'] == 1]

Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 
False


Observations and Changes Made:
The code provided does not correctly implement the steps outlined in the question breakdown. Here are the modifications needed:

1. After filtering the dataframe for 'total' and 'generation', we need to drop these columns as they are no longer needed for the subsequent steps.
2. Instead of filtering the dataframe directly for 'total' greater than 500, we should filter the original dataframe (not the one with only 'total' and 'generation') for 'total' greater than 500 and 'generation' equal to 1.
3. After filtering the dataframe, we should count the number of rows to get the number of Pokémon that meet the criteria.
