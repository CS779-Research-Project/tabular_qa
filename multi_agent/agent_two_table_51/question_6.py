import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/051_Pokemon.parquet')
# Filter out the columns 'type1', 'type2', and 'generation' from the dataframe
df = df[['type1', 'type2', 'generation']

Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 
160


Observations and Changes Made:
The code is almost correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The filtered dataframe is not assigned to a variable. This can be fixed by assigning the filtered dataframe to a variable, e.g., `df_filtered = df[['type1', 'type2', 'generation']]`.
2. The filtering condition for the 'generation' column is incorrect. It should be `df_filtered = df_filtered[df_filtered['generation'] == 2]` to get the second generation.
3. The unique types are not counted correctly. The `unique()` function should be used on the 'type1' and 'type2' columns combined. This can be done by creating a new column 'type' that combines 'type1' and 'type2', and then using `df_filtered['type'].nunique()` to count the unique types.
4. The result is not printed correctly. The count of unique types should be printed instead of the count of rows.
