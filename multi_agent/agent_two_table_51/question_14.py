import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/051_Pokemon.parquet')
# Filter out the column'speed' from the dataframe
speed = df['speed']
# Sort the dataframe by'speed' in descending order
sorted_speed = speed.sort_values(ascending=False

Here is the output of the code-block present in the above conversation : 


Observations and Changes Made : 
1. The code is missing a closing parenthesis in the sort_values function.
2. The code is not calculating the average speed of the top 3 fastest Pokémon.
3. The code needs to be modified to get the top 3 fastest Pokémon and calculate their average speed.

Re-attempted Code with Modifications :
